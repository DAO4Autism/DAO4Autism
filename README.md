# DAO4Autism

> “We talk so much about decentralizing finance. What about decentralizing **care**?”

DAO4Autism is a public-good storytelling project built for Web3 — not to focus only on autistic children, but to create space for **parents and caregivers** navigating their emotional journey in silence.

Most autism resources in Web2 focus (rightfully) on diagnosis, education, and therapy for children. But in the coming years, **parental emotional burnout** will become one of the most urgent but invisible challenges — especially for a new generation of Web3 natives who become parents.

This project is our attempt to prepare for that future.

## 🌱 Purpose

To build an **anonymous, emotionally safe, decentralized storytelling platform** where parents of autistic (and other neurodiverse) children can:

- Share emotional experiences without shame or fear  
- Find others walking a similar path  
- Create digital public goods based on real, lived experience  
- Preserve stories for the future — so no parent ever feels alone

---

## 🧩 Why Web3?

Because we believe the future of care isn’t about virality or visibility — it's about:

- **Ownership** of your narrative  
- **Privacy** without isolation  
- **Connection** across borders, without judgment  
- **Decentralized storytelling** that lasts longer than platforms
