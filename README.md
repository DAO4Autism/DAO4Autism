# DAO4Autism

> “While many platforms focus on autistic children — who supports the parents?”

DAO4Autism is a public-good storytelling project designed to support **the emotional well-being of parents and caregivers of neurodiverse children** using the decentralized tools of Web3.

Most autism-focused platforms in Web2 offer valuable clinical or educational resources for children. But the **emotional burnout, loneliness, and identity loss** experienced by parents often goes unspoken — especially in digital spaces.

We believe Web3 can offer something new:
- Anonymity without stigma  
- Ownership of one’s story  
- A decentralized, durable space for emotional truth  
- Tools to fund, preserve, and share these narratives without platform risk

## 🤝 You Are Not Alone

If you're a:

This is a seed for a new kind of support system — one rooted in care, not clicks.
