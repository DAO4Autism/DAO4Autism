  <h2>🧩 About Us</h2>
  <p><strong>DAO4Autism</strong> is a parent-first, emotionally grounded project born out of lived experience, deep listening, and silent caregiving.</p>

  <p>
    Behind this initiative is a small, multidisciplinary team led by a healthcare professional with years of voluntary experience supporting autism families.
    While we remain pseudonymous to preserve the trust of families we’ve worked with — and to protect the privacy of the stories shared with us —
    our purpose is clear:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    🌱 We exist to build a safe, decentralized platform where autism parents can express, learn, and connect — without fear of judgment or exposure.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We’ve seen firsthand how existing forums often focus solely on the child — and while that is vital, they often overlook the emotional labor, burnout,
    and invisible grief carried by parents. In autism, there is no single solution — and that’s precisely why parents need more than advice:
    <strong>they need belonging</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>DAO4Autism</strong> is not about diagnosing or fixing. It’s about holding space.
    It’s about creating a Web3-native refuge where stories matter more than labels, and connection heals more than prescriptions.
  </p>

  <h3>What We're Working On:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>📘 A series of emotionally rich e-book chapters based on real parenting struggles.</li>
    <li>🎥 Short videos with AI voiceovers and copyright-free visuals to bring unspoken feelings to light.</li>
    <li>🛡️ A future decentralized platform where privacy, solidarity, and shared learning become the pillars of a stronger autism parenting community.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>We may be pseudonymous — but our commitment is very real.</em><br>
  We build slowly, carefully, and with the hope that what we’re building today will support the hearts of tomorrow’s caregivers.</p>
